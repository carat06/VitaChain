# PROPOSED SOLUTION

Our Team proposes a centralized digital tracking platform that monitors the complete journey of organs and blood donations from donor to patient.
The system ensures transparency, safety, and efficient delivery by integrating donor registration, medical testing, storage management, real-time tracking, and environmental monitoring.

The solution aims to eliminate inefficiencies in the traditional donation supply chain by providing end-to-end visibility and automated monitoring throughout the lifecycle of a donation.
